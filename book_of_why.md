# Frequentist methods, p-values etc.
Statistical testing -> binary decision making + assumptions on the distribution.

# Non-parametric methods
Bootstrapping, empirical Bayes (false discovery rate)


# Bayesian modelling 
Modelling prob. distributions.
Assumptions required: priors + probability models

Still, only generative models (these are not able to answer "what if"-type of  scenarios?)

# Causal modelling
Additional assumption, causal diagrams i.e. what affects what. , what affects what?

Reasoning why double-blind random controlled trials are good for estimating causal effects.

Limitations: 
- Support only for causal structures that are DAGs, but what if there are cycles?
- How can we determine the causal diagrams in the first place? (On the other hand, bayesian model building requires similar type of modelling choices.


# Dynamic models

E.g. in physics the models are 

# Neuroscience reflections:
- functional MRI -> correlations
- dynamic causal modelling (very challenging, but the direction to go?)

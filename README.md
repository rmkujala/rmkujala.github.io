## Welcome to my (learning) Blog

I aim to write here mostly about my learnings on 
different topics I have read or otherwise learned about.
Primarily, the things I write here are to support my own learning on these topics, 
but I'm happy if someone else benefits from these learning summaries as well.


*Some topics on my current write up list:*

- Thoughts brought up by reading the Book of Why: From frequentist methods to Bayesian, and causal methods.
- On Product management: Product strategy, Agile & the Shape Up -method by Basecamp.
- On clean code & clean architecture. 
- The 5 most important things I have learned about mobility & transportation. 
- Analogies between writing software & good scientific articles.

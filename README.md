## Welcome to Rainer's Learning Blog (under construction!)

I aim to write here about my learnings on different topics I read or learn about.

Some topics to write up at some point:

- Thoughts brought up by reading the Book of Why
- Shape Up -method by Basecamp.
- On clean code & clean architecture. 
- The 5 most important things I have learned about mobility & transportation. 
- Analogies between writing clean code & good scientific articles.


## Jekyll & Markdown -instructions:

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rmkujala/rmkujala.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
